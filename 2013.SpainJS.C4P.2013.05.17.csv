,Ole,"Talk will be dived into 3 main parts:
1. Introduction to Continuous Delivery
2. What's Hubot and what's it for? inculding a small ""getting your feet wet""-part like, what to do, to install hubot
3. Combining 1 + 2, a real life example how I managed continous deployments with hubot.

See you in Madrid!","Automated deployments with robots

Continuous deployment is the high art of devops. So there are several ways to achieve this: many use a one-click deployment tool like ‘Deployinator’, or something self-written. This talk should give some insights about how we at my old employer Digital Pioneers N.V. deploy our apps controlled by an awesome chat robot named hubot (by github). It will also show you how to simply do it the way we did it! ",Ole.Michaelis@googlemail.com,"After my traineeship at InnoGames I continued working there as a lead developer for a big social game. Next station was Digital Pioneers N.V. there I’ve done a lot of high tech protoyping and DevOps working with Symfony2, MongoDB, EC2, Scalarium, Redis, Node.js, CoffeeScript, statsd, metrics and other cool tech stuff. After I left there I joined my current company Jimdo, here I try to bring in my knowledge in software quality and cloud computing.
I really love all the new technologies from NoSQL and node.js to Metrics Driven Development and bringing cool tools and tech to my developer colleagues. And I really really enjoy speaking at conferences, like I did on TakeOff Conference 2013 or FOSDEM 2013.",CodeStars,Talk,Intermediate

With vast surges of data projected from future projects such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, it is important to rapidly generate analyses and visualizations from large datasets. Browsers are often used for data retrieval, but rarely used for analyses and visualizations.  JavaScript libraries to read the standard astronomical data formats are being developed. To push performance, these libraries incorporate the latest HTML5 APIs, such as Typed Arrays and Web Workers.  These data may now be utilized in-browser.  Images are stored in a variety of formats, ranging from eight bit integers to 64 bit floating-points.  Rendering these images require mapping the high dynamic range to a scale conducive for a computer screen.  Images are filtered through a variety of mathematical functions to emphasize different features across the image.  Renderings are accomplished using the latest browsers, fastest JavaScript engines, and utilizing the graphics card.  Tabular datasets often contain a gross number of rows that must be carefully handled to prevent locking the user interface. Web Workers allow parsing of large datasets without locking the UI.  Libraries such as Crossfilter and D3 are essential for fast mapping, grouping and visualizing of the data.  Techniques for handling large datasets are developing.  These techniques represent use cases for WebGL and various HTML5 APIs, perhaps useful beyond the discipline of astronomy.",astrojs: JavaScript for Astronomy,amit@zooniverse.org,"Amit Kapadia develops astronomical web applications.

2/16/2013 11:23:17,Massimiliano Marcon,"The Internet these days is all about APIs. Nokia has several APIs, Facebook has APIs, Foursquare, Twitter, Flickr, they all have public APIs. For companies that provide services on the Internet, APIs are a must have. With the data available through APIs, developers build the cool and inspiring stuff that shows up in your Twitter stream every day.

An API is however completely useless when it is not well documented, or when the documentation is not updated with the API itself. Developers need to know in a clear way how to make an API call, and they need to have an exact idea of the response they should expect.
Unfortunately, delivering a product often takes priority over producing good documentation while creating and maintaining documentation that evolves with the API takes time and requires quite some effort and resources. Until now.

This talk is about how my team at HERE went from an obscure bunch of JSON responses to a clean and completely self-documenting API in a matter of hours, by leveraging the power of JavaScript and some of the tools and NodeJS modules that are publicly available with open source licenses.

2/20/2013 16:19:32,Massimiliano Marcon,"Out there on the Internet web developers can find a big universe of jQuery plugins for any need you can think of. Do you need a tooltip? There's a plugin for that. Do you need to handle cookies? There's a plugin for that. Do you want a map in your website? You are in luck, there's jHERE for that!

Why do people create all these plugins? Mostly because they need a reusable component that can be easily be included into their web apps. So they build it, and then they are nice enough to make it available to everybody.

A few months back I created jHERE, with the goal of providing a super simple API for something usually complicated: maps. With jHERE you can create maps, markers, info bubbles, heatmaps and even render KMLs with one line of code.

To make life easier for the users, jHERE is however quite a complex jQuery plugin. First of all it depends on a 3rd-party API (HERE Maps) that is lazy-loaded when the plugin is first instantiated. Additionally it was built to work not only with jQuery, but with other jQuery-compatible APIs as well, e.g. Zepto.js and Tire.js. Finally, jHERE is extensible. In order to save bytes, only a small set of simple functionalities is included in the core. More advanced features can be added by writing extensions.

This talk is about the journey from the first prototype of jHERE to the final, polished version of the plugin. I will start with the basics of writing a jQuery plugin, I will dive into leveraging Promises/Deferreds when 3rd-party libraries are required for the plugin to work, and I will show how to write the minimum amount of code that is essential to guarantee compatibility with other jQuery-like libraries. Then I will go into extensibility and talk about a way to support plugins for a plugin. And finally, how can you make sure a piece of code maintains the right behavior after you make changes and across releases? You can't, unless you write tests for it, so we'll have a look at unit testing for jQuery plugins.

I promise you will see quite some code but also pretty slides.

This backend is completly made in Nodejs and Redis. There are ~30k lines of code in pure Javascript. I have learnt a lot building it and I want to talk about the main things I needed to care about.

The backend service has many features such as:

- Provides a control panel where you can define your data model (entities, fields, relationships)
- The control panel lets you browse the data having special care in usability. It is not like an excel spreadsheet. You have forms, you can browse relationships, edit geolocalizated data, drag and drop files, etc.
- There are two databases: one for development and the other one for production
- There is a REST API as well as SDKs for iOS, Android and Javascript (for both nodejs and the browswer)
- It supports web development (no other backend as a service supports this). You can host web apps in backbeam. You develop server side code to handle requests. There is a templating engine, etc. The server-side code is sandboxed usin the ""vm"" module of Nodejs. And there are many tricks to prevent malicious code that uses too much CPU or other resources or just never-ending in an infinite loop.
- Webs can have a custom domain and optionally their own SSL certificate.
- There is a custom query language called BQL developed on top of Redis. BQL is compiled to Lua scripts that run inside Redis. BQL is defined with a grammar and a parser generator creates the parser based on that grammar.
- There is also a real-time service (built on socket.io) very useful to make chat applications, multi-player games or collaborative tools.
- Finally it also supports many other features like sending custom emails, push notifications, users authentication with twitter, facebook or email+password, etc.

JavaScript has elements of two distinct programming languages: Self and Scheme. These two languages are very different - and some of JavaScript's weirdness is due to this mixing of very different language designs. The conceptual models are also very different between Self and Scheme - one is a prototypical object based language, while the other is a functional language.

4/16/2013 18:54:17,Brandon Satrom,"It doesn't take long for most developers to sniff out a poorly-designed JavaScript API. Within minutes of reading about or coding against a new library, most developers can intuit whether their long-term relationship with that library will be a pleasant or unfortunate one. While documentation, buzz and other factors certainly play into that conclusion, the largest influencer of that snap conclusion is the ""feel"" of the API itself. APIs are developer UX: A good one raises a developers enjoyment; a bad one sends it plummeting. 

As developers, we know what good and bad JavaScript APIs ""feel"" like, and yet we struggle with designing the kind of APIs that we enjoy using. But principles of good JavaScript API design do exist, and it's possible to extract them from several key libraries in the the proliferating JavaScript landscape. In this session, Brandon Satrom will do exactly that, digging into the design aspects of popular libraries like jQuery, Backbone, Knockout, Modernizer, Kendo UI and others to enumerate the designed-in qualities of these libraries that make them not only popular, but a pleasure to use.

WebGL is now more relevant than ever, and there's a lot of people

abstractions behind them.

they are abstracted behind a framework. We *need* to understand how to

4/25/2013 21:11:12,Brandon Satrom,"If you play a game of “HTML5” word association with a room full of front-end developers, “polyfill” will come up a number of times. This word, a synonym for “spackle,” “patch” or “fallback” unfamiliar to many developers until just a few years ago, has become a staple of conversations about adopting modern and open web technologies. And while polyfilling has traditionally been a mechanism for delivering modern features to non-modern browsers, the concept has expanded over the last few years to include the addition of new and experimental platform features to all browsers, including the most cutting-edge.

Before our eyes, the practice of polyfilling is evolving from an adoption technique to a full-blown design pattern that allows developers to ""spackle"" their browsers with whatever semantics they wish. AngularJS, a very popular and fast-growing app framework, encourages this practice by enabling developers to use directives to add custom HTML tags and components to your applications. 

Beyond libraries and frameworks, though, is the Web Components project, a set of specifications in the W3C designed to make the creation of custom semantics and encapsulated components a feature in the browser itself. With Web Components, if you want a <calendar> component, you need only create one yourself, and grab one from a third party.

It's a powerful idea! If the concept takes off, and we see support for Custom Elements, Templates, HTML Imports and the Shadow DOM in the major browsers, it will unlock a new set of capabilities for web developers, while adding new depth and richness to the applications we create.

Because of that, it’s difficult to find out which type of connection is best for a client, so Pusher needed a flexible way to tell clients how to establish a real-time connection efficiently and also monitor their behaviour. This talk will give you an overview on how it works, what interesting metrics we got out of it and how we evaluated them.

# Agenda

1. Why can’t we just stick with WebSockets?
2. Why Websockets are generally superior?
3. Why doesn’t Pusher just change JS on the fly?
4. Goals:
  a) improve initial connection latency,
  b) provide clients with best possible transport,
  c) keep costs reasonable,
  d) get to know our connections,
  e) have another way to balance the load.
5. Design of our connection strategy mechanism.
6. Our awesome JSON DSL for specifying strategies.
7. Pushing client status as a timeline.
8. Interesting stats and what we learned from them.

But a rich ecosystem of tools has formed around this particular structured representation of JavaScript programs, most notably the popular esprima parser. The reusability and composability of these tools has made this format the standard for all modern projects that transform, generate, or otherwise work with JavaScript programs. We will explore this burgeoning format, evaluate its design with the benefit of hindsight, and showcase some of the more useful and prominent projects that have adopted it.",SpiderMonkey Parser API: A Standard For Structured JS Representations,spainjs@michael.ficarra.me,"Michael is best known for his significant contributions to the CoffeeScript programming language, its original compiler, and his KickStarter-funded rewrite.

5/9/2013 3:00:11,Jonathan Mukai-Heidt,"One of the most common gripes about Javascript is its use of prototypes rather than classes, if the myriad tools, patterns, and frameworks that massage it into a more classical OOP model are any indicator. But are these approaches hammering a prototypal peg into a class-shaped hole? What was happening in the early 90s that made Brendan Eich reach for prototypes rather than classes when designing his new language?

To find out, let’s a take a trip back in time and examine an exciting and very different language that heavily influenced Javascript: Self. Self is an ambitious language that, among other things, introduced prototypal OOP to the programming world. What lessons can we learn from this early pioneer of prototypal languages? Can we write better Javascript by understanding Self’s goals and approach to programming? Let’s explore the ambitions of Self and see if we can suss out the advantages and disadvantages of the prototypal approach and apply what we find to our own Javascript writing.",Self Discovery: Looking for Insight in Javascript’s Esoteric Roots,johnnymukai@gmail.com,Jonathan Mukai-Heidt is an anthropologist undercover as a software engineer in NYC's burgeoning tech scene.,johnnymukai,Talk,Intermediate
5/10/2013 12:17:53,Jan Jongboom,"Recent developments in mobile browsers have given us incredible possibilities to speed up any (mobile) web application. Using an intelligent combination of appcache, indexedDB, local storage and some other HTML5 magic makes your application a gazillion times faster on subsequent reloads, allow for preloading navigation paths and offline availability as a bonus.

Two years ago I was lead developer for one of the largest mobile websites in the Netherlands (500K pageviews per day), and we spent weeks squeezing out the last percentages in performance. How amazing to see that the work we've done back then is now considered obsolete. Browsers have evolved, web standards have arised and today we can give any (mobile) web application an incredible performance boost by creating smart caching strategies; leveraging offline storage with indexed DB and local storage, appcache, and normal browser cache.

This talk is an overview of lessons learned while building mobile web applications with native capabilities for Firefox OS.

There is HUGE demand for stuff like this. For example, an example library to get started with Firefox OS development (https://github.com/comoyo/ffos-list-detail) grew from 50 to 295 stars in 48 hours after adding offline capabilities. How cool is that?",Turbocharge your mobile web app: strategies for speed and offline availability,janjongboom@gmail.com,"My name is Jan Jongboom, currently I'm a core contributor for Firefox OS employed by Telenor (a large Norwegian telecom operator). Before this I have been working on one of the most complex javascript applications ever at Cloud9 IDE. I guess I like a javascript challenge :-) Before that I worked at one of the largest Dutch websites so I know the pain when developing responsive and usable mobile websites that can also handle 500K pageviews / day.

I got a broad speaking background, last year I have been at a bunch of conferences, ranging from Singapore to Moscow and from 2 to 700 participants. Terms people use to describe my presentations on Twitter include 'funny' and 'passion'. For some moving picture material:

Speaker bio: Jan Jongboom got in a real life fight when someone declared javascript 'just some scripting language'.  During the day he channels his javascript love as a member of the Firefox OS core team at Telenor Comoyo, making bad jokes about VBScript and dreaming of happy hour.
